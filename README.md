# Tableau-Challenge
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data). However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so a dashboard was built to gain insight into the answers. Two months were compared, July of 2022 against July of 2023. This data was chosen as it is a fair-weather month, has one major holiday, and has relevant data available for comparison. The two comparisons were for the Jersey City program.

Analysis

1. What were the most popular stations between 2022 v. 2023?

Analysis:
Comparing the month of July between 2022 and 2023, discernible trends emerge, revealing station activity that underscores a surge in select locations during 2023, while the majority experienced a reduction in usage. There was a notable increase in the overall number of stations during the latter period. However, a singular station was inactive in 2023 as opposed to its operational status in 2022. The data suggests a greater prevalence of casual riders in 2022, contrasting with a discernible uptick in membership utilization during 2023.
